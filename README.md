Automatically switches from Form A to Form B in Contact Form 7 after a set number of submissions (tracked via CFDB7). Includes an admin page to view/reset submissions and email alerts when the limit is hit.<br/><br/>

Contact Form 7 is storing the data in a seralized PHP array. I am specifically targeting a registration type of Guest and when it hits a specified max number in CF7 Form Switcher settings, the forms will switch to the waitlist form.
